# GitHub Pages Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio website that I created using GitHub Pages. It is a static website that is hosted on GitHub.
The website is built using Next.js. The website is responsive and works well on all devices.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server on http://localhost:3000:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## GitHub Actions

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment is triggered when a new
commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
